This is one of my first scripts. 
It was used to get data about the clients of an internet network from an API. With this data, we select the clients who had problems with the Internet (increased attenuation of the fiber cable) and we open complaints for them to be called by the call center.
It has many mistakes that I am aware of because it was made in a hurry, but it is functional and used daily by the dispatchers of that Internet company.
